Implementation of some popular numerical optimization techniques.

1) Single-variable optimization:

   **Exhaustive Search** method was used to reduce the domain of values for minima and then used **Bisection Search** method to converge to the minimum value.

2) Multi-variable optimization:

   **Cauchy's Steepest Descent** method was implemented for locating minima for a multivariable function.

3) Constrained optimization:

   **Penalty Function** method and **Method of Multipliers** were implemented to obtain optimal solutions for constrained optimization problems. Further analysis and        challenges are discussed here.
